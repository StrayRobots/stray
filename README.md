# Stray SDK
Stray SDK is the primary way for integrating Stray Robots capabilities into your app. The SDK supports visualizing data, training models, and integrating detectors into custom solutions.

## Installation
We recommend using a virtual environment such as [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html). The environment should have `python>=3.8`.

1. `pip install "git+https://github.com/StrayRobots/stray"`
